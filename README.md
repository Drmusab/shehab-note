<summary>Docker Deployment</summary>

#### Overview

The easiest way to serve SiYuan on a server is to deploy it through Docker.

* Image name `b3log/siyuan`
* [Image URL](https://hub.docker.com/r/b3log/siyuan)

#### File structure

The overall program is located under `/opt/siyuan/`, which is basically the structure under the resources folder of the Electron installation package:

* appearance: icon, theme, languages
* guide: user guide document
* stage: interface and static resources
* kernel: kernel program

#### Entrypoint

The entry point is set when building the Docker image: `ENTRYPOINT ["/opt/siyuan/entrypoint.sh"]`. This script allows changing the `PUID` and `PGID` of the user that will run inside the container. This is especially relevant to solve permission issues when mounting directories from the host. The `PUID` (User ID) and `PGID` (Group ID) can be passed as environment variables, making it easier to ensure correct permissions when accessing host-mounted directories.

Use the following parameters when running the container with `docker run b3log/siyuan`:

* `--workspace`: Specifies the workspace folder path, mounted to the container via `-v` on the host
* `--accessAuthCode`: Specifies the access authorization code

More parameters can be found using `--help`. Here’s an example of a startup command with the new environment variables:

```bash
docker run -d \
  -v workspace_dir_host:workspace_dir_container \
  -p 6806:6806 \
  -e PUID=1001 -e PGID=1002 \
  b3log/siyuan \
  --workspace=workspace_dir_container \
  --accessAuthCode=xxx
```

* `PUID`: Custom user ID (optional, defaults to `1000` if not provided)
* `PGID`: Custom group ID (optional, defaults to `1000` if not provided)
* `workspace_dir_host`: The workspace folder path on the host
* `workspace_dir_container`: The path of the workspace folder in the container, as specified in `--workspace`
  * In alternative, it's possible to set the path via the `SIYUAN_WORKSPACE_PATH` env variable. The commandline will always have the priority, if both are set
* `accessAuthCode`: Access authorization code (please **be sure to modify**, otherwise anyone can access your data)
  * In alternative, it's possible to set the auth code via the `SIYUAN_ACCESS_AUTH_CODE` env variable. The commandline will always have the priority, if both are set
  * To disable the Access authorization code set the env variable `SIYUAN_ACCESS_AUTH_CODE_BYPASS=true`

To simplify things, it is recommended to configure the workspace folder path to be consistent on the host and container, such as having both `workspace_dir_host` and `workspace_dir_container` configured as `/siyuan/workspace`. The corresponding startup command would be:

```bash
docker run -d \
  -v /siyuan/workspace:/siyuan/workspace \
  -p 6806:6806 \
  -e PUID=1001 -e PGID=1002 \
  b3log/siyuan \
  --workspace=/siyuan/workspace/ \
  --accessAuthCode=xxx
```

#### Docker Compose

For users running Siyuan with Docker Compose, the environment variables `PUID` and `PGID` can be passed to customize the user and group IDs. Here's an example of a Docker Compose configuration:

```yaml
version: "3.9"
services:
  main:
    image: b3log/siyuan
    command: ['--workspace=/siyuan/workspace/', '--accessAuthCode=${AuthCode}']
    ports:
      - 6806:6806
    volumes:
      - /siyuan/workspace:/siyuan/workspace
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      # A list of time zone identifiers can be found at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones
      - TZ=${YOUR_TIME_ZONE}
      - PUID=${YOUR_USER_PUID}  # Customize user ID
      - PGID=${YOUR_USER_PGID}  # Customize group ID
```

In this setup:

* `PUID` and `PGID` are set dynamically and passed to the container
* If these variables are not provided, the default `1000` will be used

By specifying `PUID` and `PGID` in the environment, you avoid the need to explicitly set the `user` directive (`user: '1000:1000'`) in the compose file. The container will dynamically adjust the user and group based on these environment variables at startup.

#### User Permissions

In the image, the `entrypoint.sh` script ensures the creation of the `siyuan` user and group with the specified `PUID` and `PGID`. Therefore, when the host creates a workspace folder, pay attention to setting the user and group ownership of the folder to match the `PUID` and `PGID` you plan to use. For example:

```bash
chown -R 1001:1002 /siyuan/workspace
```

If you use custom `PUID` and `PGID` values, the entrypoint script will ensure that the correct user and group are created inside the container, and ownership of mounted volumes will be adjusted accordingly. There’s no need to manually pass `-u` in `docker run` or `docker-compose` as the environment variables will handle the customization.

#### Hidden port

Use NGINX reverse proxy to hide port 6806, please note:

* Configure WebSocket reverse proxy `/ws`

#### Note

* Be sure to confirm the correctness of the mounted volume, otherwise the data will be lost after the container is deleted
* Do not use URL rewriting for redirection, otherwise there may be problems with authentication, it is recommended to configure a reverse proxy
* If you encounter permission issues, verify that the `PUID` and `PGID` environment variables match the ownership of the mounted directories on your host system

#### Limitations

* Does not support desktop and mobile application connections, only supports use on browsers
* Export to PDF, HTML and Word formats is not supported
* Import Markdown file is not supported
